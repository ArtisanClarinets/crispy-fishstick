# INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIENCIES AUDIT

**DATE:** 2025-05-15
**AUDITOR:** Senior Principal Engineer
**STATUS:** 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS FOUND

## 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS (Deployment Blockers)

### 1. Zero Containerization Strategy
**Impact:** **High Operational Risk**
**Issue:** The repository completely lacks `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, or any container orchestration configuration.
**Business Risk:** "It works on my machine" syndrome is guaranteed. Deployments will be non-deterministic, scaling will be impossible without manual intervention, and rollback capabilities are non-existent.
**Remediation:** Create a multi-stage `Dockerfile` optimized for Next.js standalone output.

### 2. Broken & Dangerous Bootstrap Script
**Impact:** **Total Deployment Failure**
**Location:** `scripts/bootstrap-ubuntu22.sh`
**Issue:** The script contains syntax errors and logic flaws that ensure it will fail or exit prematurely.
**Evidence:**
```bash
# Line 538 approx
if [ -d "$APP_DIR/node_modules" ]; then
    # ...
fi
exit 1 # <--- Unconditional exit prevents script completion
fi     # <--- Syntax error: Unmatched 'fi'
```
**Remediation:** Rewrite the bootstrap script completely or replace with Ansible/Terraform.

### 3. Missing Deployment Pipeline
**Impact:** **No Path to Production**
**Location:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Issue:** The CI pipeline runs tests and linting but *stops there*. There is no CD (Continuous Deployment) job.
**Business Risk:** Deployment is manual, slow, and error-prone. No audit trail of who deployed what and when.

## 🟡 HIGH IMPACT GAPS

### 4. Production SQLite Dependency
**Impact:** **Scalability Bottleneck**
**Location:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `scripts/bootstrap-ubuntu22.sh`
**Issue:** The system is configured to use SQLite (`provider = "sqlite"`).
**Business Risk:** SQLite locks the entire database file for writes. In a multi-user environment (even just administrators), this will cause `SQLITE_BUSY` errors and massive performance degradation immediately. It does not support horizontal scaling.
**Remediation:** Migrate to PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS or Aurora).

### 5. Lack of Monitoring Sidecars
**Impact:** **Blindness**
**Issue:** No configuration for Datadog, Prometheus, or ELK stack agents.
**Remediation:** Add monitoring agent configuration to the (missing) Docker setup.

## 🟠 MEDIUM IMPACT GAPS

### 6. No Backup Strategy
**Impact:** **Data Loss Risk**
**Issue:** No scripts or cron jobs defined for database backups.
**Remediation:** Implement automated S3 offsite backups for the database.

### 7. Hardcoded Ports
**Impact:** **Configuration Drift**
**Location:** `package.json`
**Issue:** `PORT=3005` is hardcoded in the start script.
**Remediation:** Use environment variables for port configuration.
