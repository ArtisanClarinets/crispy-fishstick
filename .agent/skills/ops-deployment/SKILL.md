# Ops Deployment

This skill details the custom build and deployment pipeline for Project SENTINEL. It ensures system integrity through cryptographic proofs, automated server bootstrapping, and hardened security configurations.

## Quick Start

Deploy a new version in 4 steps:

1.  **Verify Environment**: Ensure all required secrets are set in `.env` or `/etc/default/vantus`.
2.  **Run Build Proof**: Execute `npm run build` to generate the cryptographic build proof and compile the app.
3.  **Apply Migrations**: Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` to update the production database.
4.  **Restart Services**: Restart the Systemd service and reload Nginx to apply changes.

```bash
# Example: Manual deployment sequence
npm run build
npx prisma migrate deploy
sudo systemctl restart vantus
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Core Concepts

### 1. Build Proof System
We use a "Build Proof" system instead of a standard `next build` to ensure the integrity of the running code.
*   **Artifact**: `scripts/generate-build-proof.mjs` creates a cryptographic signature of the build.
*   **Verification**: The app exposes `/proof/build.json` for runtime integrity checks.

### 2. Automated Bootstrapping (Ubuntu 22.04)
Fresh production servers are configured using `scripts/bootstrap-ubuntu22.sh`.
*   **Security**: Creates an unprivileged `vantus` user and configures UFW.
*   **Stack**: Installs Node.js, Nginx, SQLite, and Certbot.

### 3. Environment Configuration
Interactive setup via `scripts/setup-env.js` ensures secure secret generation and correct database wiring.

## Ops Workflows

### Troubleshooting a Failed Build

**Step 1: Check Build Logs**
Review the output of `npm run build`. Look for errors in the `generate-build-proof` step or Next.js compilation.

**Step 2: Verify Dependencies**
Ensure `package-lock.json` is consistent and all dependencies are installed via `npm ci`.

**Step 3: Validate Environment**
Run `node scripts/setup-env.js --verify` to check for missing or invalid environment variables.

### Updating Nginx Configuration

**Step 1: Generate Config**
Run `npm run generate:nginx` to create a new configuration based on current environment variables.

**Step 2: Test Configuration**
Always run `sudo nginx -t` before reloading to prevent downtime due to syntax errors.

**Step 3: Apply Changes**
Execute `sudo systemctl reload nginx`.

## Advanced Patterns

### Zero-Downtime Migrations
For complex schema changes, use a dual-write strategy or ensure migrations are backward-compatible with the currently running code version.

### Integrity Monitoring
Integrate the `/proof/build.json` endpoint with external monitoring tools to detect unauthorized code changes or deployment drift.
