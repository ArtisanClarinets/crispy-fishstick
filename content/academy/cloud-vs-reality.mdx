# The Cloud Rent Premium

Marketing tells you that the cloud is "pay for what you use." In reality, for steady-state workloads, it is "pay for the option to leave."

When you reserve an instance for 1 year or 3 years, you are admitting that your workload is stable. Yet, even with a Reserved Instance (RI), you are paying for the *virtualization overhead* and the *managed service margin*.

## The Math of Ownership

Owning hardware (or leasing dedicated metal) removes the "multi-tenancy tax." You aren't paying for the hypervisor to manage 50 other neighbors. You aren't paying for the cloud provider's R&D on features you don't use.

### When Cloud Wins
- **Burst workloads:** You need 1000 cores for 2 hours, then 0.
- **Micro-scale:** You spend less than $500/mo total.
- **Global Edge:** You need presence in 20 cities instantly.

### When Metal Wins
- **Databases:** Steady IOPS, high RAM requirements.
- **AI Training:** Long-running GPU tasks where vGPU overhead hurts.
- **Core Business Logic:** Anything that runs 24/7.

## What to do next

Don't blindly lift-and-shift. Audit your utilization. If your CPU graph looks like a flat line, you are donating money to Amazon/Google/Microsoft.
