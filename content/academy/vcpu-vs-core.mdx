# vCPU vs. Core

One of the greatest marketing tricks of the decade was redefining a "CPU" as a "vCPU."

A vCPU is typically a single **hardware hyperthread**. A physical Core typically has 2 hyperthreads.

So, when you buy "2 vCPU", you are buying **one physical core**... that you might have to share with a neighbor.

## The Noisy Neighbor Problem

In a multi-tenant cloud, your vCPU is a timeslice. If your neighbor decides to mine crypto or compile the Linux kernel, the CPU cache (L1/L2/L3) gets thrashed. Your application slows down, but your CPU usage metric might still look low because you are "waiting" for memory access.

## Truth in Advertising

When we say "Core" in our Infrastructure Hub, we mean a **Physical Core**. Dedicated. Yours.

<EvidencePanel
  claim="2 vCPUs = 1 Physical Core"
  verdict="true"
  dataPoint="On Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC, 1 physical core supports 2 threads (vCPUs). Cloud providers sell threads, not cores."
  source="Intel Architecture Manuals / AWS Documentation"
/>

## Why it matters

For consistent latency (jitter), you want dedicated cores. Jitter kills user experience more than low average speed.

[Build a Spec](/infrastructure/configurator) with real cores and see the difference in predicted throughput.
