# Fintech Dashboard

## Overview

A high-performance trading dashboard built for institutional investors. The challenge was to render real-time market data with minimal latency while maintaining a responsive and accessible user interface.

## The Challenge

-   **Volume:** Handling 50k+ updates per second via WebSocket.
-   **Performance:** Maintaining 60fps rendering during peak market activity.
-   **Reliability:** Zero-downtime deployment requirement.

## Solution

We utilized a custom WebGL renderer for the charts to offload processing from the main thread. State management was handled via a custom optimized store to prevent unnecessary React re-renders.

## Results

-   **40%** reduction in data-to-glass latency.
-   **100%** test coverage on core financial logic.
