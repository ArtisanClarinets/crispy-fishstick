# Admin Portal & API Overview

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides an overview of the "Admin Views" and API architecture for the Vantus System application.

**Current Status:**
As defined in the **Product Requirements Document (PRD v1.0, Section 2)**, the Admin Portal and authenticated views are explicitly **out of scope** for the current public-facing release.

> **2. Non-goals (explicitly out of scope)**
> 1. Admin dashboards, authenticated portals, billing, or customer logins.

Consequently, there is no `app/admin` directory, and there are no administrative API routes (`/api/admin/*`) currently implemented. The application is designed as a stateless, public-facing marketing and information site.

## 2. API Inventory

The application currently exposes a minimal set of API endpoints tailored for public interaction (Contact Form) and verification (Proof).

### 2.1 Public APIs

#### `POST /api/contact`
- **Purpose:** Handles contact form submissions from the public website.
- **Location:** `app/api/contact/route.ts`
- **Security & Integrity:**
  - **Schema Validation:** Uses `zod` to validate all incoming fields (name, email, budget, message, etc.).
  - **Rate Limiting:** Implements IP-based rate limiting (in-memory) to prevent abuse.
  - **Honeypot:** Detects and silently ignores bot submissions via a hidden `honeypot` field.
  - **Timing Attack Mitigation:** Rejects submissions that occur faster than humanly possible (< 1500ms).
  - **Origin/Referer Check:** Enforces strict origin checks to prevent CSRF and unauthorized usage from external sites.
  - **Data Handling:** Submissions are validated and stored locally in `contact_submissions.json` (simulating a backend service). PII is not logged to the console.

#### `GET /api/proof/headers`
- **Purpose:** A lightweight endpoint to verify server responsiveness and header configurations.
- **Location:** `app/api/proof/headers/route.ts`
- **Security:**
  - **Cache Control:** Explicitly sets `Cache-Control: no-store` to prevent stale data.
  - **Minimal Surface:** Returns only a status flag and timestamp.

## 3. Missing or Planned APIs

Per the current PRD, there are **no missing APIs**. The application is fully "wired together" for its intended public scope. Future phases (as hinted in PRD Appendix A) may introduce:

- **CMS Integration:** For dynamic content management (currently static MDX).
- **CRM Integration:** To route contact submissions to a real CRM instead of a JSON file.
- **Auth Endpoints:** If an Admin Portal is introduced in a future release.

## 4. Security & Hardening Review

A comprehensive review of the codebase confirms that the application is hardened for its current public-facing role:

1.  **Strict Middleware:** `middleware.ts` enforces strong Content Security Policy (CSP), including `script-src 'nonce-...'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, and HSTS.
2.  **Input Validation:** All user input (Contact API) is strictly validated against a Zod schema.
3.  **No Admin Backdoors:** There are no hidden `/admin` routes or unprotected management endpoints.
4.  **Dependency Safety:** `npm install` runs cleanly, and the project relies on standard, maintained packages.

## 5. File Structure Overview (Admin Related)

| Path | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `app/admin/` | ❌ Not Present | Out of scope per PRD. |
| `app/api/admin/` | ❌ Not Present | Out of scope per PRD. |
| `middleware.ts` | ✅ Present | Handles security headers; no auth logic required yet. |
| `app/api/contact/route.ts` | ✅ Present | Secured public endpoint. |
