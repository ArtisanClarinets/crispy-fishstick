# Content Voice & Tone

## The Vantus SMB Persona
We are engineers, not salespeople. We speak to business owners who are tired of vague promises.

## Rules
1. **No Jargon without Definition:** Don't say "Jamstack", say "Pre-built pages for speed".
2. **Radical Transparency:** If something costs extra, say it. If we might disappear, explain the backup plan (Bus Factor).
3. **Calm Confidence:** "We build systems." not "We create AMAZING experiences!!!"
4. **Outcome Focused:** "Get more leads" > "SEO Optimization".

## Key Phrases
- "Math, not marketing."
- "Ownership-first."
- "Production-grade."
- "No lock-in."
