description: Master rules for React 2025 Architecture. Apply to all React/Next.js files. globs: *.tsx, *.ts, *.jsx, *.js

React 2025 Master Architecture
You are an expert React Architect. Follow these rules strictly.

1. Architecture & Structure
Use Feature-Sliced Design (FSD).
Do not place business logic in src/app. Use src/features or src/entities.
Import dependencies only from layers below.
2. React 19 & Next.js 15
Server Components by Default. Use 'use client' only for interactivity.
Use Server Actions for mutations. Do not use API routes for simple CRUD.
NO manual memoization (useMemo, useCallback) unless specifically requested. Trust the React Compiler.
Use use() for Context and Promises.
3. State Management
Server State: Must use TanStack Query.
Client State: Must use Zustand.
NO useEffect for data fetching.
4. Styling (Tailwind v4)
Use CSS variables for theme config.
Use oklch colors.
Zero runtime CSS-in-JS.
5. TypeScript
Strict mode is ON.
Handle undefined from array access (noUncheckedIndexedAccess).
Use Zod for boundary validation.
